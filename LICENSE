ORC Licensing

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is published using the ORC License. The ORC License provides a way for game creators to openly share the mechanics of their game and allows for downstream users to freely use, modify, and reshare adaptations of these game mechanics.

What is openly shared under the ORC is known as **Licensed Material** , and includes the broad functional elements of the game, such as statblocks, game rules, character attributes, and the methods and systems inherent in playing the game, as well as anything else the licensor explicitly wants to share. The license is broad and lets you use the Licensed Materials globally in connection with printed books, video games, podcasts, AI, or any other technology that may exist or be created in the future. The vast bulk of the content found in _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ constitutes Licensed Material.

What is not shared under the ORC is known as **Reserved Material** and includes trademarks, world lore, story arcs, distinctive characters, and visual art. We have listed Reserved Material in the ORC Notice, below.

Under the ORC License you can use, share, adapt, and build on the Licensed Material however you see fit, so long as you give proper attribution in the form of a notice in your published work. This notice both credits the upstream licensors and their contribution to the work, as well as providing an easy way for downstream users to credit the author of the work in which the notice appears. By using material licensed under the ORC, you automatically agree to license out your game mechanics in your published work under the same terms. If you develop your own Reserved Material, that is your exclusive property.
