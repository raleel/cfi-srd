# Chapter 3: Classes

Every _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ character starts the game having been trained in a Class. This Class is the career the character has embarked on as part of the transition to adulthood, and it further defines the character's skills development.

Players are free to choose a racially and culturally appropriate Class for their character, provided that the Games Master deems it suitable. The write-ups give some guidance as to the races that commonly gravitate toward that Class. These suggestions are not definitive and may be altered by player choice, or to suit more exotic game settings. For example, in a campaign based on a dying desert world, where the halflings are a tribal, cannibalistic people, it would not be out of the question to allow them to become berserkers. The players should not view these race/culture restrictions as hard and fast rules, but rather as standard starting points. Players should feel free to suggest alternatives to their Games Master who, in turn, may allow a normally unusual combination of Race and Class to fit a more out-of-the-ordinary campaign setting or reward a creative background story.

#### Class Rank Structure

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ 's Class and Rank structure is based on various organizations such as Orders or Guilds. For example, the Fighter's Guild, Clerical Order, Magic-User's Guild, and Thieves' Guild.

Rank is used as a tool to guide character development and most Class structures are arranged in a pyramidal hierarchy. Common members (Rank 0) form the base of the pyramid and are the most numerous members of a Class.

Higher ranks (Rank 1–5) represent professional members of the Class, who are working full time under its edicts.

Numbers diminish as one advances up through the ranks until only a handful of individuals, or even only one, occupy the upper echelons. Advancement brings greater privilege, prestige, learning, and sometimes, magic, or other benefits.

#### Increasing in Rank

Characters seek to rise in the ranks in the pursuit of greater respect, reputation, or responsibility, or simply out of a thirst for knowledge and power.

Each Class requires several Class skills at a particular level for Advancement. When the character is first created, these skills will determine the character's initial Rank. Having any 5 Class skills at 40% or greater will place the character at Rank 1, since it demonstrates that the person is capable and worthy of the special Abilities of that Rank. Otherwise, the character begins at Rank 0. When the character finally becomes Rank 1, all Abilities that are not specified as Ranked, may be acquired at no cost in Experience Rolls, as the character can be assumed to have been practicing these Abilities in play. Ranked Abilities may be purchased normally with Experience Rolls once Rank 1 is attained.

When a further degree of mastery is reached, based on the character's Skills, the character again increases in Rank. At that point Abilities and spells rated at that Rank may be learned, as the character has demonstrated the necessary level of comprehension and skill.

For the most part, if the character is in good standing with any Oaths required of the Class and possesses the required number of Class skills at the required level, the character will automatically increase to the appropriate Rank. Each Rank above 1 also allows characters to add another Luck Point to their total, giving them a better chance of surviving tougher encounters without needing to artificially increase their Hit Points. Each Class possesses a table detailing the skill requirements per Rank, as well as a summary of any available Ranked Talents and/or Abilities. The following provides a description of each element within these tables:

- **Rank:** A numerical representation of the character's Rank.
- **Title:** The title granted a character of the appropriate Rank.
- **Advancement:** The number of class skills and the required skill level needed to gain the relevant Rank. These may be chosen from any of the listed class skills. There is no need to select them beforehand. Skills that receive a +40 bonus, such as Customs and Native Languages, never count towards advancement.
- **Spells in Memory:** If applicable, this shows how many spells of each Rank you may have memorized.
- **Hit Points:** Certain ranks grant an additional Hit Point, which is added to all locations. The noted value includes all previous bonuses.
- **Luck Points:** Each Rank after the first grants the character 1 additional Luck Point. The noted value includes all previous bonuses.
- **Action Points:** Certain ranks grant an additional Action Point. The noted value includes all previous bonuses.

## Cleric

Clerics are the militant arm of a religious order and are skilled in protecting their religion and its followers. During times of relative peace, clerics travel the land spreading the word of their pantheon and seeking converts. Clerics are blessed with the ability to cast spells by the deities of their pantheon and are also masters of combat against the undead, possessing the capacity to drive them away with but a spoken prayer.

#### Common Species/Culture

Any.

#### Important Characteristics

STR, INT, POW, and CHA

#### Alignment/Oath Requirements

- Alignment: Any, as appropriate to pantheon or deity.
- Clerical Oath 30% plus character's INT+POW.

See [Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md).


In addition to racial/cultural Alignment and Passions, all clerics swear an Oath of Conduct to their clerical order and the deity or pantheon of deities the order venerates. Part of the Oath typically includes tithing 10% of all wealth to the order. Where a pantheon is concerned, the character's Alignment will be used to help determine which deities of the desired pantheon will be worshipped. Typically, an order will devote themselves to all deities of a specific pantheon with like Passions. A cleric typically aligns with all deities of a specific pantheon with an Alignment not contrary to their own. For example, a cleric with a Good Alignment would serve and respect all good and neutral deities of their pantheon. They may work against those deities of an evil disposition, or even acknowledge and respect them, but would offer them no worship. A True Neutral cleric may choose either good or evil deities along with those of neutral disposition if desired but could not choose both.

#### Class Skills

- **Standard Skills:** Combat Skill (Cleric), First Aid, Influence, Insight, Locale, Sing, Willpower
- **Professional Skills:** A cleric automatically receives Channel and Devotion (specific pantheon or deity), plus 3 additional skills from the following: Bureaucracy, Courtesy, Culture (any), Healing, Lore (Alchemy), Lore (Religion), Language (any) or Lore (any), and Oratory.

#### Cleric Armor and Weapon Proficiency

Clerics are proficient with all types of armor (light and heavy), and with all shields (except tower shields). Clerical Divine spell casting is not hindered by the wearing of armor. Their Combat Skill includes the use of all basic weapons. Specialty clerics may have access to different weapons as a part of their Combat Skill. This is beyond the scope of this document however Games Masters may apply this information if they decide to.

### Rank Structure

All clerics are rated by Rank, which is a rating of power and skill. When a specific degree of mastery is gained in a limited number of Class skills, clerics may increase their Rank as they will have demonstrated the necessary level of aptitude. When this level of aptitude is reached an addition Luck Point is gained and new Abilities may be acquired. This information is found on the following table under Advancement. Assuming you meet the prerequisites, your character begins as a Rank 1 Initiate with the appropriate Abilities noted below; otherwise, you start as a Rank 0 Lay Member with the Ability to cast Rank 0 spells, but no other Abilities.

##### Cleric Rank Table

| **Rank** | **Title** | **Advancement** | **Spells in Memory** | **Hit Points** | **Luck Points** | **Action Points** |
| :-: | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | Lay Member | - | Rank 0: (INT/4) | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| 1 | Initiate | Any 5 Class skills at 40% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +1<br> Rank 1: (INT/4) | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| 2 | Cleric | Any 5 Class skills at 70% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +2<br> Rank 1: (INT/4) +2<br> Rank 2: (INT/4) | +1 | +1 | +1 |
| 3 | Priest or Priestess | Any 4 Class skills at 90% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +3<br> Rank 1: (INT/4) +4<br> Rank 2: (INT/4) +2<br> Rank 3: (INT/4) | +1 | +2 | +1 |

| 5 | Grand Priest or Grand Priestess | Any 2 Class skills at 130% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +5<br> Rank 1: (INT/4) +8<br> Rank 2: (INT/4) +6<br> Rank 3: (INT/4) +4<br> Rank 4: (INT/4) +2<br> Rank 5: (INT/4) | +2 | +4 | +2 |

#### Starting Abilities

The cleric knows all the following Abilities at Rank 1. In addition, during character creation, you may choose one Rank 1 Ability for free assuming you meet its requirements.

- **Spellcaster:** Clerics are masters of Divine magic, able to cast spells of healing, defense, and protection to aid their allies. However, they are not without powerful offensive spells to smite those that stand against their ideals. Unlike magic-users, clerics require no spell book, having access to all spells of their Rank or below. Casting spells requires 1 or more Cast Magic Actions consisting of a few brief prayers, somatic gestures with their holy symbol, and a successful Channel roll. The number of spells of their current Rank a cleric may have in memory is found on the [Cleric Rank Table](0003_Classes.md?id=cleric-rank-table) above under Spells in Memory.
- **Starting Spells:** A cleric begins with access to all Rank 0 cleric spells and all others of their Rank or less. See the [Cleric Spell List](0003_Classes.md?id=cleric-spell-list). They do not actually know them, like a magic-user 'knows' spells, but may pray for any of them when choosing which spells to memorize. The number of spells the cleric may memorize at each Rank is found on the cleric's Rank Table above. See [Memorizing Spells](0009_Magic.md?id=memorizing-spells) for more details.
- **Turn Undead:** Clerics may turn undead, driving them away by means of faith alone. [Turning Undead](0003_Classes.md?id=turning-undead) is covered in detail below.

#### Ranked Abilities

Like the name implies, Ranked Abilities are only selectable by a character of a certain Rank or higher. Most have a Prerequisite Skill that must be at a certain skill level or higher. You are not locked out of earlier Abilities when a new Rank is attained. If you failed to take a Rank 2 Ability for example, you may go back and take it at Rank 3 or even later. No more than a single Ranked Ability may be taken per session.

#### Rank 1:

For each expenditure of 1 Experience Roll you may gain one of the following Abilities (one per session, and each Ability may only be taken once):

- **Powerful Concentration:** Requires Devotion of 50% or higher. Willpower tests to maintain Concentration regarding spells and spell casting are one grade easier.
- **Greater Turning:** Requires Willpower of 60% or higher. Turning Power may be re-rolled if desired, however the new roll must be used.
- **Holy Smite:** Requires Devotion and Willpower of 50% or higher. The cleric may increase their Damage Modifier by one grade against undead, demons, and devils. Usable once per day per Rank attained.
- **Mental Strength:** Requires Devotion of 60% or higher. Once per day you find it 2 grades easier to perform Willpower checks when resisting any form of magic that targets the mind. This includes such powers as beguiling, charm, domination, hold, hypnosis, Magic Jar, possession, sleep, suggestion, and psionic mind blast. It has no effect on skills such as Influence or Seduction. You also find it 1 grade easier to Disbelieve illusions and phantasms. In the case of elves, this does not stack with their resistance to Sleep and Charm, but it does broaden their ability to resist additional effects.
- **Weapon Precision:** You are adept at using small, concealable, weapons that do not require a lot of strength, subtly and effectively. This allows you to calculate Damage Modifier with these weapons based on STR+DEX instead of STR+SIZ if it would generate a better result. The Damage Modifier cannot exceed weapons normal damage die. For example, a dagger with a damage of 1d4+1, would be limited to a Damage Modifier of +1d4, making it 1d4+1+1d4. This covers clubs, daggers, garrotes, knives, shortswords, main gauche, and rapiers. as well as unarmed attacks. Darts, slings, short bows, and javelins fall into this category as well.

#### Rank 2:

For each expenditure of 2 Experience Rolls you may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- **Characteristic Increase:** You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes I:** Defensive Reflexes requires you to be Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor. Once per combat you may re-roll a Failed Parry or Evade roll without spending a Luck Point.
- **Extra Turning:** Requires Devotion and Willpower of 80% or higher. The cleric may double the number of times between rests that they may Turn. Twice at Rank 1, four times at Rank 3, and six times at Rank 5.
- **Mental Strength II:** Requires Mental Strength and Devotion of 80% or higher. As per Mental Strength I, but usable twice per day.
- **Ranged Touch (X):** Requires Willpower of 80% or higher. This Ability allows the caster to give a spell with a Range of "Touch," a Range of 30 feet instead. The spell is considered one Rank higher with regards to memorization and should be noted as ranged when memorized. For example, Cure Minor Wounds (Ranged) would count as a Rank 2 spell.

#### Rank 3:

For each expenditure of 3 Experience Rolls you may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- **Characteristic Increase:** You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Improved Holy Smite:** Requires Holy Smite, as well as Devotion and Willpower of 90% or higher. Holy Smite's Damage Modifier is now increased by two grades against undead, demons, and devils.
- **Mental Strength III:** Requires Mental Strength II and Devotion of 100% or higher. As per Mental Strength I, but usable three times per day.

#### Rank 4:

For each expenditure of 4 Experience Rolls you may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- **Characteristic Increase:** You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes II:** Requires Defensive Reflexes. As per Defensive Reflexes, however you may now use this Ability twice in the same combat. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once, however.
- **Mental Strength IV:** Requires Mental Strength III and Oath or Devotion of 120% or higher. As per Mental Strength I, but usable four times per day.

#### Rank 5:

For each expenditure of 5 Experience Rolls you may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- **Characteristic Increase:** You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Greater Holy Smite:** Requires Improved Holy Smite, as well as Devotion and Willpower of 130% or higher. Holy Smite's Damage Modifier is now increased by four grades against undead, demons, and devils!
- **Mental Strength V:** Requires Mental Strength IV and Oath or Devotion of 140% or higher. As per Mental Strength I, but usable five times per day.

### Cleric's Basic Starting Equipment

Each line item counts as 1 'Thing' for Encumbrance purposes unless otherwise noted.

- Mace
- Heater shield (counts as 2 Things)
- Light crossbow
- Quiver with 20 crossbow bolts
- Full set of scale armor, 4 Armor Points (0 Things when worn, 7 Things if carried)
- Wooden holy symbol of deity (½ a Thing)
- Backpack (10 Thing capacity); waterskin, one week's trail rations, bedroll, small empty sack\*, flint and tinder\*\*, 2 six-hour torches (5½ Things contained)
- Belt pouch with 1d4 gold pieces

Total ENC 7½ Things

_\* Contents count toward the backpack's contents as its volume is increased._

_\*\* Counts as ½ a Thing._

### Turning Undead

Clerics of any Alignment may attempt to Turn any undead within 30 feet. Evil clerics may choose to control undead instead, if desired. You may attempt to Turn Undead once at Rank 1, twice at Rank 3, and three times at Rank 5. You regain all uses of Turn after a Short Rest of at least 1 hour.

_For example, Alexandra is a Rank 4 cleric. She can attempt to turn two times during an encounter, and if she rests at least an hour after, will regain both uses._

**Turning Power:** A cleric's Turning Power modifies the total Intensity of undead who are successfully Turned. This is equal to 1d6+2, +2 per additional Rank beyond 1, and should be noted on the Character Sheet, as the character uses it whenever succeeding at a Turn attempt.

_For example, at Rank 2, Alexandra has a Turning Power of 1d6+4_

To attempt a Turning requires an Opposed skill test using Channel skill vs. the relevant creature with the highest Willpower within the Area of Effect. The degree of success determines the effects of the attempt.

Evil clerics may command their Turning Power in Intensity of undead. This effect allows the cleric to issue commands to the undead but does not make them subservient unless they roll a Critical Success and choose Enslave - see below. Those with the lowest Intensity are always affected first. This has no effect on Intensity 7 or higher undead. An evil cleric may use this to bring previously turned non-sapient undead under their control once again.

- **Critical Success:**  Twice your Turning Power in Intensity undead are affected. If your Rank is twice the Intensity (or more) of a non-sapient undead creature, you destroy outright any that you would normally Turn.
  - Evil clerics may instead command twice their Turning Power in Intensity of undead for 12 Rounds (1 minute). As undead are typically of the same mindset as an evil cleric, this effect allows the character to issue commands to the undead. It does not make them subservient, as with Enslave below, and sapient undead will not needlessly throw away their unlife. Those with the lowest Intensity are always affected first. This has no effect on Intensity 7 or higher undead. An evil cleric may use this to bring previously turned non-sapient undead under control once again.
  - Alternately, an evil cleric scoring a Critical Success may Enslave their Turning Power in Intensity of undead, enslaving them to their control. Enslaved undead are completely subservient to the cleric until their control is somehow broken. Those with the lowest Intensity are always enslaved first. This has no effect on Intensity 7 or higher undead. An evil cleric may use this to bring previously turned undead under control once again.
- **Success:**  Your Turning Power in Intensity of undead are affected, starting with those of the lowest Intensity first. If insufficient Turning Power is rolled to affect anything, then nothing is turned during this attempt. The cleric repulses those affected, which must move and stay at least 20 feet away for 12 Rounds (1 Minute). The affected cannot attack any members of the cleric's party who remain within the Area of Effect unless the affected are forced within 10 feet of the party. Those that cannot move the full distance due to intervening terrain cower (any Attack rolls against them are one Difficulty Grade easier). Approaching within 10 feet of the affected causes the undead to overcome being Turned and act normally. Ranged attacks no closer than 10 feet do not break the Turning effect; however, such attacks on a sapient undead will break the effects of the Turn, allowing the creature to react normally. Sapient creatures, once Turned, are allowed a Hard Willpower roll each Round to try to break the effect; however, sapient creatures likely voluntarily flee the area and return only when they again have the advantage. If the cleric's Rank is twice the Intensity (or more) of a non-sapient undead creature, the cleric destroys outright any that they would normally Turn.
  - An evil cleric may command their Turning Power in Intensity of undead creatures, bringing them under their control. This effect allows the cleric to issue commands to the undead. It does not make them subservient, as with a Critical, and sapient undead will not needlessly throw away their unlife. Those with the lowest Intensity are always affected first. This has no effect on Intensity 7 or higher undead. An evil cleric may use this to bring previously turned non-sapient undead under their control once again.
- **Failure:**  No undead are Turned.
- **Fumble:**  Not only did you fail to Turn anything, but you have drawn the attention of several undead equal to twice your Turning Power in Intensity. These entities target you specifically, with lowest Intensity entities provoked first.

## Fighter

Fighters are professional soldiers, mercenaries, and warriors, and the most common adventurers in the worlds of fantasy. Whether breaking down doors, wielding swords and axes with both skill and finesse, or interposing themselves between the party's less martial members and the opposition, wherever you find adventure, you will find the fighter.

#### Common Species/Culture

Any.

#### Important Characteristic

STR, CON, and DEX

#### Alignment/Oath Requirements

- Alignment: Fighters are not restricted by Alignment and require no Oath.

See [Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md).

#### Class Skills

- **Standard Skills:** Athletics, Boating or Ride, Brawn, Combat Skill (Fighter)\*, Endurance, Evade, Unarmed\*
- **Professional Skills:** Craft. (any), Engineering, Gambling, Intimidation, Lore (Military History), Lore (Strategy and Tactics), Oratory, Survival or Navigate

_\* Receives a +5 bonus from Combat Proficiency_

#### Fighter Armor and Weapon Proficiency

Fighters are proficient with all types of armor (light and heavy), and with all shields. Their Combat Skill includes the use of all basic and martial weapons.

### Rank Structure

All fighters are rated by Rank, which is a rating of power and skill. When a specific degree of mastery is gained in a limited number of Class skills, fighters may increase their Rank as they will have demonstrated the necessary level of aptitude. When this level of aptitude is reached, an additional Luck Point is gained, and new Abilities may be acquired. This information is found on the [Fighter Rank Table](0003_Classes.md?id=fighter-rank-table) under Advancement. Assuming you meet the prerequisites, your character begins as a Rank 1 Fighter with the appropriate Ranked Abilities noted below; otherwise, you start as a Rank 0 Warrior with no current Abilities.

##### Fighter Rank Table

| **Rank** | **Title** | **Advancement** | **Hit Points** | **Luck Points** | **Action Points** |
| :-: | :-- | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **0** | Warrior Trainee | - | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| **1** | Warrior | Any 5 Class skills at 40% | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| **2** | Fighter | Any 5 Class skills at 70% | +1 | +1 | +1 |
| **3** | Hero/Heroine | Any 4 Class skills at 90% | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| **4** | Champion | Any 3 Class skills at 110% | +2 | +3 | +2 |
| **5** | Lord/Lady | Any 2 Class skills at 130% | +2 | +4 | +2 |

#### Starting Abilities

The fighter knows all the following Abilities at Rank 1. In addition, during character creation, you may choose one Rank 1 Ranked Ability for free assuming you meet its requirements.

- **Combat Proficiency:**  Being an expert in armed combat, fighters gain a further +5% to their Combat Skill and Unarmed skill.
- **Weapon Specialization:** Your combat training has allowed you to choose a single weapon for specialization, this may be a shield as well. Weapon specialization grants benefits depending on the specific weapon selected and is summarized below.
  - **Melee Weapon:**  You receive the following specialization benefits to a single melee weapon: 
    - Your Combat Skill is improved by +5% when using your weapon of specialization. This bonus will not aid in Rank Advancement.  
    - You gain a bonus Parry when wielding this weapon. This does not require the use of an Action Point.
  - **Ranged Weapon:**  You receive the following specialization benefits to a single Ranged Weapon:  
    - If not surprised you may automatically fire first (before rolling for Initiative) at the beginning of combat, assuming both weapon and ammo are readied. You state your intent to fire, resolve the results, and then Initiative is rolled.  
    - When aiming at a target within the weapon's Close Range, aiming requires 1 Turn steadying the weapon instead of a full Round, and makes the following attack 1 grade easier. Attacks made beyond Close Range follow the normal rules for aiming as found under [Ranged Combat](0008_Combat.md?id=ranged-combat) in Chapter 8. Additional Rounds spend aiming grant no further advantage.  
    - A specialist may reduce the reload time of any mastered Ranged Weapon by 1. A weapon with 0 reload time may effectively be readied as a Free Action.
  - **Shields:**  You receive the following specialization benefits to ALL shields:  
    - Your Combat Skill when using any shield is improved by +10%. This skill bonus will not aid in Rank Advancement.  
    - All shields count as 1 Size category larger for the purposes of Parrying damage: Large to Huge, Huge to Enormous, and Enormous to Colossal.

#### Ranked Abilities

As the name implies, Ranked Abilities are only selectable by a character of a certain Rank or higher. Most have a Prerequisite Skill that must be at a certain skill level or higher. You are not locked out of earlier Abilities when a new Rank is attained. If you failed to take a Rank 2 Ability for example, you may go back and take it at Rank 3 or even later.

This allows you to calculate Damage Modifier with these weapons based on STR+DEX instead of STR+SIZ if it would generate a better result. The Damage Modifier cannot exceed the weapons normal damage die. For example, a dagger with a damage of 1d4+1, would be limited to a Damage Modifier of +1d4, making it 1d4+1+1d4. This covers clubs, daggers, garrotes, knives, shortswords, main gauche, and rapiers. as well as unarmed attacks. Darts, slings, short bows, and javelins fall into this category as well.

##  Magic-User (Mage)

Magic-users study the esoteric, digging through old musty tombs for new and elusive spells to add to their spell books. They spend much of their free time studying these spells and learning to master the powers found within them. While weak starting out, mages have the potential to become the most powerful of the Classes.

#### Common Species/Culture

Any, but typically Civilized and Nomadic humans, as well as gnomes, elves, and half-elves. Gnomes that become mages tend to gravitate toward the School of Illusion.

#### Important Characteristics

DEX, INT, and POW

#### Alignment/Oath Requirements

- Alignment: Mages are not restricted by Alignment and require no Oath.

See [Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md).

#### Class Skills

- **Standard Skills:** Evade, First Aid, Influence, Insight, Locale, Perception, Willpower
- **Professional Skills:** A mage automatically receives Arcane Casting and Arcane Knowledge, plus 3 additional skills from the following: Culture (any), Language (any), Lore (Alchemy), Lore (any)

#### Mage Armor and Weapon Proficiency

Mages are not proficient with any type of armor or shields, as Arcane spells require precise gestures and movements during casting, which are hindered by the wearing of armor. They are typically not trained in physical combat; therefore, the mage Combat Skill may only be developed with Bonus Skill Points. It includes the use of daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, and light crossbows, simple weapons commonly found around their master's residence or that are relatively easy to pick up and learn.

### Rank Structure

All mages are rated by Rank, which is a rating of power and skill. When a specific degree of mastery is gained in a limited number of Class skills, mages may increase their Rank as they will have demonstrated the necessary level of aptitude. When this level of aptitude is reached an additional Luck Point is gained and new Abilities may be acquired. This information is found below on the [Mage Rank Table](0003_Classes.md?id=mage-rank-table) under Advancement. Assuming you meet the prerequisites, your character begins as a Rank 1 Journeyman with the appropriate Abilities noted below; otherwise, you start as a Rank 0 Apprentice with the Ability to cast Rank 0 spells, and no other Abilities.

##### Mage Rank Table

| **Rank** | **Title** | **Advancement** | **Spells in Memory** | **Hit Points** | **Luck Points** | **Action Points** |
| :-: | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **0** | Apprentice | - | Rank 0: (INT/4) | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| **1** | Journeyman | Any 5 Class skills at 40% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +1<br> Rank 1: (INT/4) | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| **2** | Mage | Any 5 Class skills at 70% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +2 <br> Rank 1: (INT/4) +2 <br> Rank 2: (INT/4) | +1 | +1 | +1 |
| **3** | Adept Mage | Any 4 Class skills at 90% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +3 <br> Rank 1: (INT/4) +4 <br> Rank 2: (INT/4) +2 <br> Rank 3: (INT/4) | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| **4** | Arch Mage | Any 3 Class skills at 110% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +4 <br> Rank 1: (INT/4) +6 <br> Rank 2: (INT/4) +4 <br> Rank 3: (INT/4) +2 <br> Rank 4: (INT/4) | +2 | +3 | +2 |
| **5** | Grand Arch Mage | Any 2 Class skills at 130% | Rank 0: (INT/4) +5 <br> Rank 1: (INT/4) +8 <br> Rank 2: (INT/4) +6 <br> Rank 3: (INT/4) +4 <br> Rank 4: (INT/4) +2 <br> Rank 5: (INT/4) | +2 | +4 | +2 |

#### Starting Abilities

The mage knows the following Abilities at Rank 1. In addition, during character creation, you may choose one Rank 1 Ability for free assuming you meet its requirements.

- **Spellcaster:** While mages are very weak at the beginning of their careers, at the other end of the spectrum, they can cast the most spectacular and powerful of spells, able to burn armies, and collapse castles with impunity. All Arcane spells require precise gestures and movements (the spell's somatic component) during casting, which are hindered by the wearing of armor. See the [Casting in Armor](0009_Magic.md?id=casting-in-armor) section for specific information. The number of spells of their current Rank a mage may have in memory is found on the [Mage Rank Table](0003_Classes.md?id=mage-rank-table), above, under Spells in Memory.
- **Starting Spells:** Cantrips are the first magical abilities taught to an apprentice mage and are fully defined in the [Spells](0010_Spells.md) chapter. A mage begins with knowledge of the Rank 0 cantrip Read Magic, as well as two cantrips (Rank 0) for every 1/10th Arcane Knowledge (skill x 0.1). If the mage qualifies as Rank 1, they also know one Rank 1 spell for every 1/10th Arcane Knowledge. The number of spells the mage may have prepared at each Rank is found above on the [Mage Rank Table](0003_Classes.md?id=mage-rank-table) under Spells in Memory. See the [Mage Spell List](0003_Classes.md?id=mage-spell-list) below and the section on [Memorizing Spells](0009_Magic.md?id=memorizing-spells).

#### Ranked Abilities

As the name implies, Ranked Abilities are only selectable by a character of a certain Rank or higher. Most have a Prerequisite Skill that must be at a certain skill level or higher before it may be selected. You are not locked out of earlier Abilities when a new Rank is attained. If you failed to take a Rank 2 Ability for example, you may go back and take it at Rank 3 or even later. No more than a single Ability may be taken per session.

#### Rank 1:

For each expenditure of 1 Experience Roll you may gain one of the following Abilities (one Ability per session, each Ability may only be taken once):

- **Mental Strength:**  Requires Arcane Casting of 60% or higher. Once per day you find it 2 Difficulty Grades easier to perform Willpower checks when resisting any form of magic that targets the mind. This includes such powers as beguiling, charm, domination, hold, hypnosis, Magic Jar, possession, sleep, suggestion, and psionic mind blast. It has no effect on skills such as Influence or Seduction. You also find it 1 grade easier to Disbelieve illusions and phantasms. In the case of elves, this does not stack with their resistance to Sleep and Charm, but it does broaden their ability to resist additional effects.
- **Weapon Precision:**  You are adept at using small, concealable, weapons that do not require a lot of strength, subtly and effectively. This allows you to calculate Damage Modifier with these weapons based on STR+DEX instead of STR+SIZ, whichever generates a better result. The Damage Modifier cannot exceed the weapon's normal damage die. For example, a dagger with a damage of 1d4+1, would be limited to a Damage Modifier of +1d4. This covers clubs, daggers, garrotes, knives, shortswords, main gauche, and rapiers. As well as unarmed attacks. Darts, slings, short bows, and javelins fall into this category as well.

- **Mental Strength II:**  Requires Mental Strength and Arcane Knowledge of 80% or higher. As per Mental Strength, but usable twice per day.
- **Ranged Touch (X)**: Requires Willpower of 80% or higher. This Ability allows the caster to give a spell with a Range of "Touch," a Range of 30 feet instead. The spell is considered one Rank higher with regards to memorization and should be noted as ranged when memorized. For example, Invisibility (Ranged) would count as a Rank 2 spell.

#### Rank 3:

For each expenditure of 3 Experience Rolls you may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- **Characteristic Increase:** Add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes:** Defensive Reflexes requires you to be Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor. Once per combat you may re-roll a Failed Parry or Evade roll without spending a Luck Point. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once however, nor combine with a Luck Point.
- **Mental Strength III:** Requires Mental Strength II and Arcane Knowledge of 100% or higher. As per Mental Strength, but usable three times per day.

## Rogue

Rogues are the experts in subterfuge, specializing in stealth, traps, lockpicking, and other skills that society often views with suspicion. However, while all thieves are rogues, not all rogues are thieves. Rogues survive by their wits, using their skills of infiltration and stealth for the greater good. However, the greater good often depends on which side of the diamond one is standing.

#### Common Species/Culture

Any

#### Important Characteristics

DEX, INT, and CHA

#### Alignment/Oath Requirements

- Alignment: Rogues are not restricted by Alignment and require no Oath unless they are a member of a thieves' guild.
- Thieves' Guild Oath 30% plus character's INT+POW

See [Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md).

In addition to any racial/cultural Alignment and Passions, rogues who choose to join a thieves' guild must swear an Oath and follow all the normal rules set forth in [Using Alignment and Passions](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md?id=using-alignment-and-passions). In addition, they must abide to the following strictures: display loyalty to other members, abide by all guild rules, act in the guild's best interests (putting the guild before personal interests), keep the guild's secrets safe, pay guild dues, and pay a cut of any job 'sanctioned' by the guild.

Dues vary by location and guild size, but around 100 gold per year is standard. In addition to yearly dues, members are required to pay a cut of any jobs where the guild helped in the form of contacts, tipoffs, maps, general information, and so on. The specific amount of the cut should be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the assistance provided, but an average of 20%, modified up or down is about right. In exchange, the guild provides temporary shelter to the member and their allies, as well as any other services the Games Master deems appropriate. Fences are available to help move stolen merchandise, and through these contacts, a thief can be expected to get about ¼ the item's sale value. Most thieves' guilds have a presence in most major cities and even some large towns.

A rogue may choose to join a thieves' guild after character creation if the Games Master allows. While joining a thieves' guild during character creation costs the character nothing, joining later costs 100 Gold per current Rank, and takes 1 month of training and initiation. After the allotted time, the character takes on the thieves' guild title appropriate to their Rank and adds the Thieves' Guild Oath at 30% plus POW+INT.

#### Skills

Because of their diverse nature, rogues possess more skill choices than the standard allotment. However, they do not receive any extra Skill Points.

- **Standard Skills:** Athletics, Combat Skill (Rogue), Deceit, Evade, Insight, Perception, Stealth
- **Professional Skills:** A rogue automatically receives Lockpicking and Mechanisms, plus two additional skills from the following: Acrobatics, Acting, Commerce, Disguise, Intimidation, Seduction, Slight, or Streetwise. At character creation, members of the Thieves' Guild also receive Language (Thieves' Cant) at +40. If they take it later, they do not receive the +40 bonus.

#### Rogue Armor and Weapon Proficiency

Rogues are proficient with all types of armor (light and heavy), and with all shields (except tower shields). However, they do suffer penalties to many rogue Abilities when wearing heavy armor or when they are encumbered. Their Combat Skill includes the use of all basic weapons, plus hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords.

### Rank Structure

All rogues are rated by Rank, which is a rating of power and skill. You may choose either the rogue or thief titles, depending on whichever is more relevant to your relationship with the thieves' guild. When a specific degree of mastery is gained in a limited number of Class skills, rogues may increase their Rank, as they will have demonstrated the necessary level of aptitude. When this level of aptitude is reached an addition Luck Point is gained and new Abilities may be acquired. This information is found on the following table under Advancement. Assuming you meet the prerequisites, your character begins as a Rank 1 Scoundrel or Burglar with the appropriate Abilities noted below; otherwise, you start as a Rank 0 Scamp or Cutpurse with no other Abilities.

#### Starting Abilities

The rogue knows all the following Abilities at Rank 1. In addition, during character creation, you may choose one Rank 1 Ability for free assuming you meet its requirements.

- **Climb Walls:**  You are particularly good at climbing anything up to a sheer surface. If you are Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor, you may ignore 1 Difficulty Grade to your Athletics roll when performing any attempt at climbing. In addition, the Armor Penalty to Base Movement when climbing may be ignored.
- **Hide in Shadows:**  You are an expert in stealth and have perfected the art of hiding in shadows. If you can position yourself in an area enshrouded in shadow, all Perception rolls to spot you are 1 Difficulty Grade harder.
- **Sneak Attack:**  The rogue may attempt to neutralize a victim from an advantageous position if armed with a small or medium melee weapon or using a Ranged Weapon within 30 feet of the victim. The target must be generally humanoid in form and possess vital organs. It has no effect on a dragon or gelatinous mass, for example. Because the attacker is typically able to strike without hindrance, they gain Choose Location as a bonus Special Effect if successful. However, the location selected must be the target's head, chest, or abdomen to gain any of the following additional benefits.
  - The attacker may ignore any negative Damage Modifier that normally applies, the Special Effects Bypass Armor and Maximize Damage do not require a Critical Success.
  - It is not necessary for the rogue to gain surprise on the victim; however, the attack must be made from outside the victim's field of vision. Therefore, many rogues wait for an opponent to become engaged with an ally and then take advantage of the distraction to strike from behind. Parrying or Evading a Sneak Attack first requires a Perception roll, a Hard Perception roll if the victim is already distracted. If successful, defending against the attack coming from the side is Formidable, while defending against the attack from behind is a Herculean task! Sneak Attack may only be used on the same target more than once if they remain distracted or otherwise unaware of their attacker.
- **Subterfuge:**  Because rogues are masters of infiltration, the skills Lockpicking, Mechanisms, and Sleight are one Difficulty Grade easier.

#### Ranked Abilities

As the name implies, Ranked Abilities are only selectable by a character of a certain Rank or higher. Most have a Prerequisite Skill that must be at a certain skill level or higher. You are not locked out of earlier Ranked Abilities when a new Rank is attained. If you failed to take a Rank 2 Ability for example, you may go back and take it at Rank 3 or even later. No more than a single Ranked Ability may be taken per session.

#### Rank 1:

For each expenditure of 1 Experience Roll the Rogue may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- **Agile:**  Requires Evade or Acrobatics at 60% or higher. Assuming you are Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR) and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor, you may utilize your superb reflexes in combat. When calculating Initiative, you may add +4 to the total.
- **Artful Dodger:**  Requires Evade of 50% or higher. This talent requires you to be Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR) and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor. You possess fast reflexes and may use the Evade skill to dodge a melee attack without falling prone. Against a ranged attack, you only end up prone if you Fail the roll.
- **Great Hearing:**  Requires Perception of 50% or higher. Your acute hearing makes all Perception rolls that pertain to hearing one Difficulty Grade easier.
- **Sharp Eyed:**  Requires Perception of 50% or higher. Your acute eyesight makes all Perception rolls that pertain to vision one Difficulty Grade easier.
- **Skirmishing:**  Requires Athletics and Combat Skill of 50% or higher. This Ability permits launching ranged attacks in the same Round in which you run (but not while sprinting). However, the attacker's attack percentage cannot exceed his Athletics skill.
- **Swashbuckling:**  Requires Combat Skill of 50% or higher. Assuming the character is Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR) and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor, they may engage in attacks and evades made while jumping or swinging into (or disengaging from) combat, ignoring any skill cap placed on it by the Athletics skill.
- **Unarmored Defense:**  Requires the Artful Dodger Ability and either Evade or Acrobatics at 50% or higher. Your character is extremely hard to hit when unhindered by armor. When Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR) and wearing NO armor, your Evade rolls are one Difficulty Grade easier.
- **Vaulting** (requires Acrobatics): Requires Acrobatics at 50% or higher. When Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), you may use your Acrobatics skill to pole vault according to the following rules. Using a pole of at least quarterstaff length and moving at least at running or sprinting speed, you may vault over obstacles or up onto out-of-the-reach locations. This requires a successful Easy Acrobatics roll, and if successful, will allow you to vault horizontally up to twice your own height +1d4+6 feet. A successful vertical vault will allow you to reach heights equal to the length of the quarterstaff (6 to 9 feet); however, vaulting vertically causes you to end up prone. A character without this Ability that possesses the Acrobatics skill may attempt this feat at normal difficulty. On a Critical Success with a horizontal vault, the distance vaulted may be increased by half again. A Critical Success while vaulting vertically allows you to land upon your feet.
- **Weapon Precision:**  You are adept at using small, concealable, weapons that do not require a lot of strength, subtly and effectively. This allows you to calculate Damage Modifier with these weapons based on STR+DEX instead of STR+SIZ, whichever generates a better result. The Damage Modifier cannot exceed double the weapon's normal damage die. For example, a dagger with a damage of 1d4+1, would be limited to a Damage Modifier of +1d4, making it 1d4+1+1d4. This Ability covers clubs, daggers, garrotes, knives, shortswords, main gauche, and rapiers. As well as unarmed attacks. Darts, slings, short bows, and javelins fall into this category as well.

#### Rank 2:

The rogue's Sneak Attack Ability now does +1d2 damage with melee weapons, no additional damage with ranged weapons. In addition, they may take the following Abilities at a cost of 2 EXP rolls each (each may only be taken only once):

- **Characteristic Increase:**  You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes:**  Defensive Reflexes requires you to be Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor. Once per combat You may re-roll a Failed Parry or Evade roll without spending a Luck Point. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once however, nor combine with a Luck Point.
- **Read Languages:**  Requires Oath at 70% or higher and one month of training with the thieves' guild. Only Members of a thieves' guild may take this Ability. You have learned to read any language, even those you do not normally know. This is not a complete understanding of all languages, but the chance to pick up a word here or a phrase there and piece it together. The main use of this skill is the understanding of notes, instructions, and treasure maps, but can be used to attempt to decipher any otherwise unknown language. Read Languages is a Professional Skill and starts at Base Level of INTx2. The Games Master should roll this skill check, keeping the results secret, as you would not know whether you have successfully translated the text, or just think you did. A Success will reveal a few useful pieces of information equal to your (INT/4) while a Critical Success will reveal several pieces of information equal to your INT/2. On a Failed roll, you learn no information whatsoever. Finally, on a Fumble, you only believe that you know the correct subject matter and the Games Master can feed you false information.

#### Rank 3:

The rogue's Sneak Attack Ability now does +1d4 damage with melee weapons, +1d2 additional damage with ranged. In addition, they may take the following Abilities at a cost of 3 EXP rolls each (each may only be taken only once):

- **Characteristic Increase:**  You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes II:**  Requires Defensive Reflexes. As per Defensive Reflexes, however you may now use this Ability twice in the same combat. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once however, nor combine with a Luck Point.
- **Use Arcane Scrolls:**  Requires Oath at 90% or higher and one month of training at the thieves' guild. Only Members of a thieves' guild may take this Ability. This Ability allows the rogue to cast spells from any magic-user scroll without the need to have previously cast Read Magic on it. This chance is equal to your INT x5%. Failing this roll automatically results in a Fumble because of your lack of training and understanding of the magical arts. A Fumble reverses the effects of the spell or sets them off on the reader, whichever is most detrimental as determined by the whim of the Games Master.

#### Rank 4:

The rogue's Sneak Attack Ability now does +1d6 damage with melee weapons, +1d4 damage with ranged. In addition, they may take the following Abilities at a cost of 4 EXP rolls each (each may only be taken only once):

- **Characteristic Increase:**  You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes III:**  Requires Defensive Reflexes II. As per Defensive Reflexes, however you may now use this Ability three times in the same combat. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once however, nor combine with a Luck Point.

#### Rank 5:

The rogue's Sneak Attack Ability now does +1d8 damage with melee weapons, +1d6 damage with ranged. In addition, they may take the following Abilities at a cost of 5 EXP rolls each (each may only be taken only once):
