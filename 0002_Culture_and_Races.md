# Chapter 2: Culture & Races

A description of each racial background follows incorporating a list of appropriate skill bonuses. Players choosing a human character need to further define their character with an appropriate culture. Players should apply the skill bonuses immediately to the Standard Skills on their Character Sheet and add the additional new skills, known as Professional Skills (introduced in the next chapter), to the appropriate section of the sheet. In many cases a race lists a range of skills and invites the player to pick one or more, that will gain a bonus: in this way players from identical racial backgrounds can ensure that their adventurers are different in the areas they have developed.

Also note that each race comes with a typical Alignment and several Passions (see [Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md)). Alignment and Passions can add a great deal of depth and characterization to the adventurer you are creating, defining ingrained preferences and prejudices as well as defining the character's moral values.

## Humans

Humans can inhabit just about any location in a fantasy world and can have contact with any and every species at one point or another. Some of the demi-human and humanoid races look upon humans as their staunchest of allies; others view them as the most vindictive of enemies. They can reach ages close to 100 years, sometimes even exceeding it, though rarely naturally. Humans tend to be fast learners and are more adaptive to change than any of the other races. Many believe that humans are the chosen race of the gods, a belief that is not without some merit, as the demi-human races seem to be on the decline in comparison to humans. Of course, some demi-human races attribute this to the voracious nature of human expansion.

### Human Culture

Of all the playable races, only humans choose a separate culture, which helps them to further define themselves. Note that each culture can be even more granular and can be altered to be very much region-specific. Demi-humans in comparison are less widespread, and as a result, their culture is more homogeneous and entirely subsumed under their race. The following information details the four types of human cultures.

### Barbarian

Tribal in nature, barbarians tend to shun civilization, viewing those who live in large towns and cities as weak and corrupt. Although their own settlements are also sedentary, they tend to be far smaller and closer to nature. Barbarian tribes occupy distinct territories, often half-tamed wilderness, which they regard as their own for hunting, grazing, and farming purposes. Most are adept in the use of weaponry as they must overcome many dangers throughout their lives – facing creatures of the wilds or mustering to defend their lands against rival tribes. Since they live in small communities the ties of kinship and clan are strong elements of their society.

#### Skills

- **Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40
- **Standard Skills:** Athletics, Brawn, Endurance, First Aid, Locale, Perception; and either Boating or Ride
- **Professional Skills:** Craft. (any), Healing, Language (Any\*), Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigate, Seamanship, Survival, Track

\* Humans are not limited in selection of languages during character creation if they can justify the choice.

#### Alignment and Passions

- **Alignment:** Any, choose one or two from an Ethical Code (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic), and one or two from a Moral Code (Good, Neutral, or Evil). Alternately, choose one or two from True Neutral.
- **Other Passion:** Any, but typically one or two from the following:
  - Loyalty to Clan Chieftain
  - Love (friend, sibling, or romantic lover)
  - Hate (magic, creature, rival, or clan)

#### Special Rules

- **Movement:** 20 feet.
- **Survival Bonus (Specific):** Barbarians find all Survival rolls pertaining to their area of origin one grade easier.
- **Exposure Tolerance:** Barbarians suffer reduced effects from exposure to temperature extremes related to their area of origin. For example, if originating from cold climates, even lightly outfitted barbarians would be permitted a grace period equal to their CON in hours before exposure sets in. Wearing suitable clothing would extend this to double their CON in hours. After this point they need to seek shelter or start to suffer Fatigue loss. See the Weather Tables on page XX for additional information.
- **Illiterate:** Barbarians are typically unable to read or write. They may learn literacy by spending 1 Experience Roll and a month of training under a character literate in the desired language. This gives them basic literacy equal to half skill level in one language the character knows. If desired, another 1 Experience Roll and a month of training will give them full literacy. When learning new languages in play, it can be assumed they are learning them at full literacy level.
- **Lucky:** Humans start with one additional Luck Point.

### Civilized

The Civilized culture is epitomized by a semblance of law and order, underpinned by complex social codes, and supported by a bureaucracy. Civilized people believe themselves superior to all other cultures because their achievements tend toward permanence: sprawling cities, imposing temples, celebratory monuments, and the recording of history and events in books, tomes, and scrolls. Of course, this is a thin veneer. The most Civilized of cities can be more lawless than any Barbarian frontier settlement; and the social codes may be cruder than the hospitality rituals of nomads. But the Civilized culture prides itself on its achievements, its infrastructure, its professional artisans, and its ability to easily extend its reach to wherever it wishes to go.

### Nomadic

Nomadic people are constantly on the move, with no home and hearth to call their own. They may wander aimlessly about or might have several camps they move to and from throughout the year. They raise few crops and instead follow the migrations of animals or fish, perhaps even herding their own domesticated beasts. Nomads are adept at subsisting on what they can quickly and easily scavenge from their surroundings, letting nothing go to waste. The skills of the nomad culture should be tailored to their environment. Some journey vast distances on foot, others live in caravans or ride strange creatures, and some drift. across the oceans on great floating rafts.

### Primitive

Of all peoples, primitives are those that live closest with the land, in tune with its hidden secrets. Living in extended family groups, primitive cultures gather around very simple dwellings that can range from caves and areas of natural shelter through to lean-tos or very basic huts. Primitives are typically hunter-gatherers with either few, or poorly developed, systems for farming and husbandry.

However, certain cultural beliefs, often based on superstitions, can be very well defined. Few primitive cultures have developed anything approaching a written language although paintings and other pictorial symbols serve as a means of communication.

When learning new languages in play, it can be assumed they are learning them at full literacy level.
- **Lucky:** Humans start with one additional Luck Point.

## Demi-Human Races

Demi-human characters are created in almost the same way as humans. Characteristics are determined using the Characteristic dice for that species, which will result in different Characteristic values and ranges, but otherwise all the other elements: Attributes, Culture, Class and so on, are factored as normal.

---
### Dwarf

Dwarves make their homes deep inside mountain strongholds, where extensive tunnels burrow deep into the earth. The average dwarf is strong, tough, and untiring in battle. By nature, they are excellent crafters, often having a propensity for mining and metallurgy, with an accompanying love for treasure and all things material. Their goods are highly sought after by all.

Dwarves are short of stature and somewhat stocky, being between 4' 8" and 4'10" tall on average. Hair color is generally black, gray, or dark brown, but a few are known to exhibit reddish hair. Their skin is ruddy or earth colored. All male dwarves favor long beards, often spiked, braided, or forked. Some dwarven women also grow beards; however, most prefer to keep their faces clean-shaven.

Dwarves are naturally suspicious of anyone espousing a different way of life to their own but are not necessarily antagonistic toward them. They get along best with gnomes, who share a distant kinship, despite their annoying sense of humor and penchant for practical jokes. In addition, dwarves tend to get along well with humans; however, they have a low tolerance of elves due to ancient wars and long memories. Dwarves tend to dislike halflings, whose carefree lifestyle clashes with their gruff, stern nature. Their hatred for orcs, which they view as filthy and bestial, is legendary.

Dwarves are long-lived and can reach ages of around 450 years. They have a distinct aversion to magic and as such find themselves naturally resistant to Arcane spells; Divine spells affect them normally. Because of this, dwarven magic-users are unheard of.

#### Dwarven Culture

Dwarves are social creatures bonded into clans and tribes that share the great underground halls and cities. In this respect, they most closely resemble the Barbarian culture, although there are certain key differences. First, gender does not matter in dwarven society: males and females share duties and responsibilities equally. This includes child-rearing, manual labor, hunting, and war. Second, dwarves tend to downplay the individual in favor of the society.

Dwarves know that strength comes from numbers and that the wants and needs of the individual are always outweighed by the many. They are, however, an acquisitive and materialistic society, jealously guarding their discoveries and achievements. Dwarves like things, and when removed from the clan a lone dwarf can become selfish and individualistic very quickly, because the overall dwarven culture is absent to guide and control the baser instincts.

#### Skills

- **Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40, Language (Dwarf) +40
- **Standard Skills:** Athletics, Brawn, Endurance, Evade, Locale, Perception, Willpower

  - Loyalty to Clan
  - Love (Something Materialistic)

#### Special Rules

- **Movement:** 15 feet.
- **Darkvision:** Dwarven Darkvision enables them to see up to 60 feet in dim light as if it were bright light (standard Perception rolls to spot something) and in darkness as if it were dim light (Perception rolls to spot something are Hard). Within that darkness, they discern colors only in shades of gray. Darkvision does not allow vision in magical darkness.
- **Literate:** Dwarves are typically able to read and write any language they can speak.
- **Magic Resistance:** Magic Resistance: Dwarves are highly resistant to Arcane Magic; their Willpower Checks are one grade easier when used to resist. This resistance has no effect on Divine magic.
- **Poison Resistance:** Dwarves are also highly resistant to poison, with Endurance rolls that relate to poisoning being one grade easier.
- **Tunnel Sense:** Due to their subterranean nature, dwarves can detect certain underground phenomena by succeeding at an Easy Perception skill roll. Tunnel Sense may be used to detect stonework pits, deadfalls, and traps; a slope or grade; approximate depth underground; new tunnel or passage construction; and shifting or sliding walls or rooms. The range of this detection is limited to 10 feet.

### Elf

Elves are around the same height as humans and possess graceful and slender builds. Very few elves leave their woodland realm and take up the adventuring life, instead preferring a peaceful woodland existence. Those that do are a mystery to even their own kind. Though elves get along reasonably well with halflings and gnomes, they do not mesh well with dwarves due to their rather gruff nature. Even humans are viewed with suspicion. Of all the races, orcs and goblins are despised above all due to a long-standing animosity based on endless wars and petty skirmishes. Like dwarves, elves are very long-lived, but even more so, reaching ages of around 1,100 years. However, long before this, elves often feel the need to depart the realms of men. To where they go is a mystery to all but themselves.

Elves are distinctive with their fine bone structure, narrow tapering skulls, and narrow pointed ears. Eye colors vary through the spectrum, from the human tones through to the color of brilliant gems. Elven society is frequently monarchical, usually governed by a king, queen, or both. Elves are otherworldly. They often seem remote from mundane events yet exhibit a comprehension of them that proves baffling for humans to understand. Nature is of great importance to the elves and so they take great care to preserve their environments. As a long-lived species, they do not accept or appreciate time in the same way as humankind and are often unconscious of the passing of short time increments.

#### Elven Culture

Elven culture is akin to Civilized. Great store is placed on learning and understanding. Deeds, conduct, and integrity are important and desired qualities among elves and in others. Dignified manners are expected, and loutish, uncouth behavior viewed with disdain and suspicion. Most elven societies have a king or queen and so loyalty to the monarch is paramount. Elves have trouble understanding societies that lack such structures, wondering how people can be properly ordered without a clear, royal leader to guide and represent them.

#### Skills

- **Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40, Language (Elf) +40
- **Standard Skills:** Conceal, Influence, Insight, Locale, Perception, Stealth, Willpower

#### Alignment and Passions

- **Alignment:** Any, but typically Chaotic Good, choose one or two from each, or select a different Alignment.
  - **Chaotic** (Curious, Freedom, Suspicious)
  - **Good** (Admirable, Altruistic, Angelic, Charitable, Compunctions against harming innocents, Decent, Ethical, Forgiving, Friendly, Hates Evil, Helpful, Kind, Loves nature, Merciful, Optimistic, Positive, Vegetarian)
- **Passion:** Any, but typically one or two from the following:
  - Loyalty to King/Queen
  - Love (Something emotional)
  - Hate (any enemy of grace and beauty)

#### Special Rules

- **Movement:** 20 feet.
- **Elven Chain:** Elves are adept at casting Arcane Magic spells while wearing elven chain and may cast such spells at one level of difficulty.
- **Literate:** Elves are typically able to read and write any language they can speak.
- **Resistance to Sleep and Charm:** Elves find Willpower rolls to resist _Sleep_ and _Charm_ spells 2 grades easier. This includes all spells of the _Enchantment (Charm)_ School (_Charm Person, Friendship, Hypnotism_, and so on). They may drop this resistance and accept the magic's effects if they choose.
- **Sharp Vision:** Due to their acute visual acuity, elves find all Perception rolls to spot something one grade easier.
- **Stealthy:** Elves wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor find Stealth tests 1 grade easier.

---
### Gnome

At 3'4" to 3'7" in height, gnomes are even smaller than their dwarven kin. Possessing brown or tan skin, white hair, and considerably larger noses, they are, however, less rotund overall. Possessing an almost uncontrollable tendency for practical jokes and a sense of humor that could get them killed in the shadier parts of world, gnomes balance these problematic traits with a keen love of nature almost equaling that of the elves. Like dwarves, gnomes particularly love gems and jewelry, and many are experts in the gem-cutting craft. They dwell in mines and burrows found in areas of rolling hills and woodlands secluded from humans. Gnomes are suspicious of races much larger than themselves, and apart from dwarves and halflings, that is pretty much everyone. They tend to gauge a person's true intention with a test of his or her sense of humor, not the wisest of methods surely, but it seems to work for them. Gnomes are expert tellers of tall-tales and wild stories. Of all the races, they get along best with dwarves, but in general are more willing to accept others. Typically, gnomes can live to around 700 years.

#### Culture

Gnomish culture is a clannish society that spends much of its time mining and crafting fine jewelry. Their lives are well organized with their leadership culmination with that of a chief, and religious matters being handled by the chief's cleric advisors. In this way their culture is like that of their dwarven kin, however they do tend to love games and practical jokes more so than their squat cousins. Their love of animals and nature means that in addition to dwarves, they relate well to elves and other woodland beings.

#### Skills

- **Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40, Language (Gnome) +40
- **Standard Skills:** Deceit, Evade, Insight, Locale, Perception, Stealth, Willpower
- **Professional Skills:** Commerce, Craft. (any), Engineering, Language (any\*), Lore (any), Mechanisms, Oratory, Survival.

\* During character creation, additional languages are limited to dwarf, halfling, goblin, and kobold.

#### Alignment and Passions

  - **Neutral** (Does not strongly feel one way or the other when it comes to Law and Chaos, Flexible, Freedom of action, Has no established Ethical Code, Respectful of nature\*)
  - **Good** (Admirable, Altruistic, Angelic, Charitable, Compunctions against harming innocents, Decent, Ethical, Forgiving, Friendly, Hates Evil, Helpful, Kind, Loves nature\*, Merciful, Optimistic, Positive, Vegetarian)
- **Passion:** Any, but typically one or two from the following:
  - Loyalty to Clan
  - Love (Something Materialistic)
  - Hate (Typically, kobolds and goblins)

\* Either Respectful of nature or Loves nature, not both.

#### Special Rules

- **Movement:** 15 feet.
- **Literate:** Gnomes are typically able to read and write any language they can speak.
- **Darkvision:** Gnomish Darkvision enables them to see up to 60 feet in dim light as if it were bright light (standard Perception rolls to spot something) and in darkness as if it were dim light (Perception rolls to spot something are Hard). Within that darkness, they discern colors only in shades of gray. Darkvision does not allow vision in magical darkness.
- **Magic Resistance:** Like dwarves, gnomes are highly resistant to Arcane Magic; Willpower Checks are one grade easier when used to resist, two grades easier with regards to illusions. This resistance has no effect on Divine magic. Many gnomes that become magic-users specialize in the School of Illusion.
- **Poison Resistance:** Gnomes are also highly resistant to poison, with Endurance rolls that relate to poisoning being 1 grade easier.
- **Tunnel Sense:** Due to their subterranean nature, gnomes can detect certain underground phenomena by succeeding at an Easy Perception skill roll. Tunnel Sense may be used to detect stonework pits, deadfalls, and traps; a slope or grade; approximate depth underground; new tunnel or passage construction; and shifting or sliding walls or rooms. The range of this detection is limited to 10 feet.

### Half-Elf

Half-elves are the offspring of an elf and a human, granting them a mixture of traits from both parents. Their appearance is closer to their elven heritage; they tend to possess attractive features. Half-elves lose some of the Abilities of elven heritage and do not have the same lucky or gifted nature as humanity; instead, they fall somewhere in-between. Half-elves possess their human parent's wanderlust and the love of nature of their elven heritage. They are also long-lived, reaching ages of around 300 years. In some parts of world, half-elves are regarded with suspicion due to their mixed heritage, but they are generally accepted everywhere elves and humans are, though they tend to receive the greatest amount of bigotry from the elven people.

#### Culture

Half-elves have no communities of their own but can be found living wherever humans and elves co-mingle, and they will typically share the culture of the race that raised them. For example, if raised among humans they will share the culture of their human parent (one of the four detailed under humans), if raised among elves they will share their elven parent's culture.

#### Skills

- **Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40, Language (Elf) +40

### Half-Orc

Originating in the wilder frontiers of world, where orcs and humans come into conflict, half-orcs are the result of the unlikely union between these two races. Genetically, half-orcs exhibit more orcish traits than human ones, standing taller than a human on average, with large prominent teeth, an extended lower jaw, and greenish skin covered with coarse dark hair. They are warlike by nature and have no interest in the more refined of pursuits. Half-orcs are on poor terms with the other races due to their orcish blood, enmity with the elves and dwarves being the greatest; but given time, a trust can develop even with these unlikely races. Of all the races the half-elves tend to be the most sympathetic, understanding the life of the outcast all too well. Strangely enough, gnomes and halflings tend to be generally accepting of half-orcs, the former because half-orcs tend to be able to take a joke, and the latter due to their curious and accepting natures. Half-orcs have natural lifespans of around 80 years.

#### Culture

Like half-elves, half-orcs have no native lands, most often living among orcish tribes. Those not living among other orcs, range toward human lands. Because they are frequently not accepted by society, half-orcs are usually drawn toward violent careers befitting their great strength and temperament, usually finding companionship among adventurers, many of whom are fellow wanderers and outsiders. Half-orcs typically share the culture of the race that raised them. For example, if raised among humans, they will share the culture of their human parent; if raised among orcs, they will share their orcish parent's culture.

#### Skills

- **Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40, Language (Orc) +40.
- **Standard Skills:** Choose from a human culture or from the following orc skilption; and either Boating, Evade, or Ride.

\* During character creation, if raised by orcs, additional languages are limited to goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll. If raised by humans, you are not limited in selection of languages if you can justify the choice.

#### Alignment and Passions

Choose from a human culture or from the following orc Passions if raised in orcish society:

- **Alignment:** Any, but typically Lawful Evil if raised by orcs, choose one or two from each or select a different Alignment. Or as per human parent.
  - **Lawful** (Adherence to tradition, Calculating, Closed-Minded, Lack of adaptability)
  - **Evil** (Abusive, Cruel, Domineering, Enjoys Harming Innocents, Hates Good, Merciless, Sadistic, Slaver, Spiteful)
- **Passion (Raised as Orc):** Any, but typically one or two from the following:
  - Loyalty to Clan Chieftain
  - Love (friend, sibling, or romantic lover)
  - Hate (magic, creature, rival, or clan)
- **Passion (Raised as Human):** Choose from an appropriate human list.

#### Special Rules

- **Movement:** 20 feet.
- **Darkvision:** Half-orc Darkvision enables them to see up to 60 feet in dim light as if it were bright light (standard Perception rolls to spot something) and in darkness as if it were dim light (Perception rolls to spot something are Hard). Within that darkness, they discern colors only in shades of gray. Darkvision does not allow vision in magical darkness.
- **Illiterate:** If raised by orcs, half-orcs are typically unable to read or write. They may learn literacy by spending 1 Experience Roll and a month of training under a character literate in the desired language. This gives them basic literacy equal to half skill level in one language the character knows. If desired, another 1 Experience Roll and a month of training will give them full literacy. When learning new languages in play, it can be assumed they are learning them at full literacy level. Half-orcs raised by another culture will be literate if that culture is also literate.
- **Survival Bonus (Specific):** If raised by orcs, half-orcs find all Survival rolls pertaining to their area of origin one grade easier.

### Halfling

Peaceful, civilized folk who live a largely agrarian existence, halflings are diminutive humanoids who standing an average of 4'0" to 4'3" tall are shorter than dwarves, but taller than gnomes. Their homes are farms and steads with villages forming close-knit communities. Halflings are the least adventurous of the races and can go largely unnoticed as they pose no kind of threat to anyone.

At first glance halflings might be mistaken for children, but the differences are obvious upon close inspection. Halflings have pointed ears, and skin, hair, and eye colors that run the normal range. They have large, rugged feet that are oversized for the body, and typically quite hairy. Shoes and boots are shunned; the soles of the feet are extremely thick, providing more than adequate protection against rocks and stones.

While they are generally unadventurous, halflings are inquisitive. They like to know, and share, secrets. They adore stories, myths, and fables and have inquiring minds. This means that, when abroad, the world is a fascinating place to be questioned and taken in – and this can lead halflings into trouble. Otherwise, halflings are a rather prosaic, content race that keeps to itself and prefer neither to interfere with the wider world nor have it interfere with them.

To most other races, halflings are short hairy-footed kleptomaniacs, a not entirely unfounded view, as most that take up a life of adventure can easily incorporate a little stealth and subterfuge due to their small size and quick fingers, but other Classes can and do exist. There is an old dwarf saying which goes, "if there is a halfling in your party check your money pouch, if it's missing check his."

Despite being physically smaller and weaker than most other sapient species, halflings compensate with a certain nimbleness that serves them well in sticky situations. Although cautious, they are not cowardly: halflings might say they are, but when it comes to fighting for their homes and way of life, they can summon enormous reserves of courage. In short, halflings make for good player characters, especially for those players who prefer sneaking around to stalking boldly across the moorland. They are long-lived, with lifespans of around 170 years.

#### Culture

Halfling culture is akin to Civilized. They live in small communities called shires, closely-knit villages and small towns with several extended families forming the basis of the community. Their industries are basic: agriculture primarily, but also handicrafts such as pottery, weaving, leatherworking, and textiles. They do work metals but very infrequently for weapons and armor. Like elves, most halflings will never leave their communities. Instead, they prefer staying at home, eating their twelve meals a day, smoking pipe weed, and drinking while socializing with friends and loved ones. But occasionally, a halfling comes along that gets the urge for adventure. The common cultural unit for halflings is the Riding; an area bounded by three shires which makes the size of each riding vary considerably. A Borough is formed of three Ridings.
